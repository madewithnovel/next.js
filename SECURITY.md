# SECURITY POLICY
November 2024

This security policy outlines the procedures for handling security vulnerabilities
and maintaining the security of the software following OWASP security principles.

## 1. SUPPORTED VERSIONS

Below are the versions of the software currently receiving security updates:

| Version | Support Status    | End of Support    |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1.x     | Full Support     | Current           |

Future versions will be announced with their respective support periods.
Legacy versions will be listed here when available.

## 2. SECURITY COVERAGE

Security support is provided for:

* All unmodified components within the Packages Directory
* Core APIs and interfaces as documented
* Authentication and authorization systems
* Data handling routines in unmodified code

Limited or no security coverage is available for:

* Modified components in the Packages Directory
* Custom code outside the Packages Directory
* Third-party integrations
* Custom deployment configurations

## 3. REPORTING A VULNERABILITY

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these steps to
report a security issue:

* DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues
* Email security@novel.dev with detailed information
* Include the following information in your report:
    * Type of vulnerability
    * Full path to source file(s)
    * Step-by-step reproduction instructions
    * Impact of the vulnerability
    * Suggested fix (if available)

## 4. DISCLOSURE POLICY

Our disclosure process follows these principles:

* Reporter receives confirmation within 48 hours
* Issue is verified and assessed within 7 days
* Fix development begins for verified issues
* Security advisory is published once patch is ready
* Public disclosure after customers have update window

## 5. SECURITY UPDATE PROCESS

Security updates follow OWASP risk assessment methodology:

* Critical vulnerabilities: 24-48 hour response
* High severity: 1 week response
* Medium severity: 2 week response
* Low severity: Next scheduled release

## 6. OWASP SECURITY PRINCIPLES

Our security implementation follows OWASP principles:

* Defense in Depth
* Principle of Least Privilege
* Secure by Default
* Fail Securely
* Security Through Design
* Input Validation and Output Encoding
* Keep Security Simple (KISS)

## 7. SECURITY FEATURES

The software implements OWASP recommended security controls:

* Strong Authentication System
* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* API Rate Limiting
* Comprehensive Input Validation
* XSS Protection
* CSRF Protection
* SQL Injection Prevention
* Security Headers
* Audit Logging
* Secure Session Management

## 8. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

We recommend following these OWASP-aligned practices:

* Regular dependency updates
* Security feature enablement as documented
* Environment variable usage for sensitive data
* Rate limiting implementation
* Audit logging enablement
* Security scanning integration
* Access control implementation
* Secure communication protocols

## 9. INCIDENT RESPONSE

In case of a security incident:

* Isolate affected systems
* Report to security@novel.dev
* Preserve logs and evidence
* Wait for response team instructions
* Document all actions taken

## 10. SECURITY MONITORING

We recommend implementing:

* System activity monitoring
* Error and access log monitoring
* Failed authentication monitoring
* API usage monitoring
* Database access monitoring

## 11. SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

We conduct annual security assessments including:

* Third-party penetration testing
* Professional security code audit
* Automated security scanning
* Dependency vulnerability monitoring
* Architecture security reviews

Results of these assessments inform our security roadmap and improvements.
Details about our latest security audit can be requested by verified customers.

## 12. MODIFICATION OF POLICY

This security policy may be updated from time to time. Check the version
number and modification date to ensure you have the latest version.
